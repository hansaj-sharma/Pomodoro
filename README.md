# Pomodoro
The secret to effective time management is...thinking in tomatoes rather than hours? It may seem silly at first, but millions of people swear by the life-changing power to the Pomodoro Technique. (Pomodoro is Italian for tomato. 🍅)

This popular time management method asks you to alternate pomodoros — focused work sessions — with frequent short breaks to promote sustained concentration and stave off mental fatigue.

Try the Pomodoro Technique if you...

<ul>
<li>Find little distractions often derail the whole workday</li>

<li>Consistently work past the point of optimal productivity</li>

<li>Have lots of open-ended work that could take unlimited amounts of time (e.g., studying for an exam, research for a blog post, etc.)</li>

<li>Are overly optimistic when it comes to how much you can get done in a day (aren't we all 🙃)</li>

<li>Enjoy gamified goal-setting


</ul>
